Define:
    - cloud based storage service.
    - store and serve user-generated content such as images, videos, and more.

features:
    - storage intigrated with firebase Auth.
    - each file assigned with a Url, can access directly using.
    - and this url to store in firebase DB.
    ~ client SDKs
    
implement:
    - dependency: firebase_storage
    - let say we have store images, import image_picker.
    - root folder: FirebaseStorage.instance.ref()
    - create a new folder in root directory: .child("folder_name")
        i.e., FirebaseStorage.instance.ref().child("folder_name").child("inside_folder").child()...
    - put file in folder: .putFile(//path) , return a uploadTask object, not url
    - running uploadTask will return uploadTaskSnapshot, then store it in var
    - url = var.ref.getDownloadURL();
    ~ * progress bar for upload: using snapshotEvents and listener.
