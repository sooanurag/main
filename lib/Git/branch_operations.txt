# Git branch operations:
    1. "git checkout branch_name" : to switch  respective branch
    2. "git checkout -b branch_name" : create new branch
    3. "git pull branch_name"
        - if you're on same branch then "branch_name" not required
        - if not, but want to get code from other branch to curr branch then, "git pull branch_name"
