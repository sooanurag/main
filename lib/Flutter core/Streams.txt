Define:
    - a StreamBuilder is a widget that helps you build your 
      UI based on the data emitted by a Stream.
    - streamController has two parts, sink and stream.
    - sink is the input data, & stream is output data.
    - if stream changes over time then the subscriber which is StreamBuilder will
      get notified through snapshot.
    * StreamBuilder widget listens to a Stream and rebuilds itself whenever new data arrives.
    * if stream data changes then it rebuilds StreamBuilder, not build method or any setState calls.
    - steps:
        1. create a controller : StreamController comtrollerName = StreamController();
        2. StreamBuilder(
            (context, snapshot){
                if(snapshot.hasData){}
                if(snapshot.connectionState){}
                if(snapshot.hasError){}
            }
        )
        3. initialize sink : this sink data will be passed to snapshot, and if change this data
           it will also effect steam.
           i.e., controllerName.sink.add(var_name);
