# what's state?
    - underlying data of a widget.
    - which can change overtime.
    - state management: to make ui interactive, have to manage state.
        - low-level: The state is separated into a separate class (State) 
          that can be updated independently of the widget using set-state.
        - high-level: tools like provider, Getx,BLoC,etc used to update a specific data of a widget.

# what's BLoC?
    - BLoC : Business Logic Component
    - state management solution.
    - separate the business logic of your application from the presentation layer.
    - which helps in making scalable, maintainable and robust app.


# BLoc vs flutter_bloc:
- BLoC: provides the logic of Bloc.
- flutter_bloc: a package which builts upon Bloc, provides features like
                blocBuilder,blocListener,etc which make state-management easy.
