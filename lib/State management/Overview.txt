State: 
    - underlying data of one/mutiple widgets at paticular point of time.
    - Ephemeral state: if data is shared to single widget.
    - app state: shared among multiple widgets.

State management: 
    - refers to controlling and handling the data that represents current state of the app.
    - to manage state: data must be centralised or at root level of the widget tree.
    - approaches:
        - high level or loosly coupled: provider,bloc,riverpod,redux,etc
        - low level or tightly coupled:
            - changes in one part of the application can have a significant impact on other parts
            - ex - setState(), InheritedWidgets(), InheritedNotifier(),etc.
