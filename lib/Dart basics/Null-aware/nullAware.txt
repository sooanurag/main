=> Used to handle null values. There are three:
    1. '?.' : Null conditional operator
        - checks right-side identifier is not-null then it'll call the right-side property.
        - "name?.length" , if "name" is null then length will not be called.

    2. '??' : Null Coalescing Operator
        - always returns left side identifier/value util its null.
        - if its null then it return right one.

    3. '??=' : Assignment If Null Operator
        - used to assign value to a variable.
        - but if the variable is not null then assigned value will not be assigned.
        - ex: 
        1.  String? name;
            name ??= "anurag";
            print(name); // output => anurag

        2.  String name = anurag;
            name ??= "garuna";
            print(name); // output=> anurag , i.e., remains unchanged
