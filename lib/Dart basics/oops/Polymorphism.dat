important points:

1. To acess base class methods only which are overriden in extended class: Upcasting
    - BaseClass _identifier = ExtendedClass();
        - creates an instance of ExtendedClass().
        - can call methods or access properties defined in BaseClass.
        - but if method in BaseClass is overriden then then the overriden method will be called.
