convert: json to dart
  - website : https://app.quicktype.io/?l=dart

Define: Response format, json and xml.
    - simple text file, whole thing is a String.
    - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), stores data in key-value pair.
    - used for transmitting data between a server and a web or mobile application.
    - JSON consists of two main data structures: json objects {} and arrays[].
    - support int, double, bool, string, null.
    - JSON doesn't support comments.
    - Special characters within strings need to be escaped using a backslash \,
      such as \" for double quotes or \\ for a single backslash. 

Syntax:
    {
        'key' : value,
        'key2' : value2
    }
    - whole enclosed thing is called json object.

Using Response Formats in Flutter:
    - parse the response using libraries like dart:convert to 
      extract the data and work with it in your app.
      i.e., import 'dart:convert'
            final decodedData = json.decode(responseBody);
            //now we can access useing key
            final username = decodedData['name'];
    - json.decode : parse a JSON string into Dart objects. allows you to quickly 
      work with JSON data without explicitly creating models.
    * if json file consists a single json object then json.decode() return a Map<String,dynamic>.
    * if its a list of json object then, List<Map<String,dynamic>>
    - json.encode() reutns a String.

    * use of seperate models: consider as good practice
        - provide Type Safety(helps catch errors), Code Readability, 
          Serialization/Deserialization, Easier Data Manipulation(access 
          and change data in the model), Scalability(helps consistent in large projects).

        - Libraries like json_serializable and freezed can help automate 
          the process of creating models from JSON data.
