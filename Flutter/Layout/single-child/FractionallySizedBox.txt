    - take double vals : 0.0 - 1.0 (0% - 100%).
    - FractionallySizedBox(
        widthFactor: /* width fraction(0-1) */,
        heightFactor: /* height fraction(0-1) */,
        alignment: /* AlignmentGeometry */,
        child: /* Your child widget */,
    )
    - this factors is the percent of size of the parent widget.
