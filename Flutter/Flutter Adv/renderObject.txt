Defination:
    - every widget is ultamately translated into renderObjects and painted on the screen.
    - a fundamental part of the rendering pipeline and is responsible for handling the layout,
      painting, and rendering of visual elements on the screen.
    - RenderObjects are lower-level objects that handle the rendering and layout of visual elements on the screen.

Use-cases:
    - Custom render : used with complex layout or animation to be render in optimized manner.
    - Contributing to the Flutter Framework: Develop custom rendering engines.
    - Performance optimization.
