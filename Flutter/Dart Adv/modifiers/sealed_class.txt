## Sealed class:
    - its a way to restrict inheritance hierarchy of a class.It's often used in conjunction
      with enums or as a replacement for enums in situations where more flexibility is required.

    - Restricting Inheritance: can extend sealed class within the same file as sealed class itself,
      can't extend them from anywhere in your codebase.
    
    - Pattern Matching: if used with switch(MySealedClass obj){}, it force to
      matech all the extended classes.
    
    - syntax: sealed class Identifier<T>
