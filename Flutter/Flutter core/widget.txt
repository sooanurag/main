Defination:
    - Building block or class which represents UI elements like layout, image, buttons,etc.
    - tree structured: 
        - from text() field, padding() to a container(), everything is widget.
        - tree define how to compose and layout widgets on screen.
    - immutable : 
        - widgets are immutable means, once created there properties cant be changed.
        - if properties changes or underlying data means its state changes.
        - which will create a new instance of that widget in the tree and replace the old one.
    - widget state: 
        - have all the underlying data that can be changed over time.
    - lifting state-up:
        - if state is managed or stored at widget level, then have to rebuild whole tree to update the state.
        - prefered practice is to lift the state at root level or outside the tree.
        - so that state can accessed and updated from external source and if change occured then will automatically
          notified to the shared state widgets.
