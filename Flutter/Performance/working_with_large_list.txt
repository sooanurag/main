# When working with a List/Grid view with large no. of items(ex:100 - 1000+):

    + Optimation using ItemExtent/PrototypeItem:
        - ItemExtent: by defining it, you tell each element has this
          fixed height (if working in vertical dir), thus Flutter doesn't 
          need to perform individual layout computations for each item.
        
        - PrototypeItem: pass the single widget of your list with data,
          flutter computes its extent and use for rest of the data.
          usecase: when you dont have the exact extent of the items
          you are using.
