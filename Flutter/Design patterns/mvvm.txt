MVVM : Model View View-model
    - follows solid principles.

View:
    - UI part
    - dont handle state inside.
    - used to pass user-interactions on ui elements to view-model.
    - dont write any logic code.
    - can handle navigation,but not any logic behind navigation.

Model: domain layer/data-access layer
    - represents data.
    -  dont handle or influence data.
    - holds actual data that will be used in application development.
    - logic part.

view_model: medium
    - provides data from model to view.
    - can write state management methods to manage state in view.
    - listener called ChangeNotifier that allows ViewModel to inform or update the View whenever the data get updated.

folders:
    - data => network,response and app_exception.dart file.
    - view, model, view_model.
    - utils
    - resource or res : contains constants, colors, urls, widgets,etc.
    - repo or repositories
