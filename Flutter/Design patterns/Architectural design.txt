Defination:
    - A blueprint for organizing and structuring software components.
    - Purpose:
        - help address recurring architectural concerns.
        - code separation, maintainability, scalability, and extensibility. 

Approaches:
    - MVC, MVVM, Bloc Pattern, Clean arch, redux, VIPER, MVP, etc.

Impementation in Flutter:
    1. Which approache to choose:
        - depends on project's requirements and complexity.
        - if you're building a simple app, you may choose MVC or Provider for state management,
          For more complex apps, consider BLoC or Clean Architecture.
    2. use State management according to design pattern.
    3. Document the architecture and component interactions.

Architectural Methods:
    - systematic approaches or processes used by software architects to plan, 
      design, and manage the architecture of a software system.
    - Approaches:
        1. Rational Unified Process (RUP)
        2. TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)
        3. Agile Architecture: include methods, scrum & kanban. Scrum is widley used.
