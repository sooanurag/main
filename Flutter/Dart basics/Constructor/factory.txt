Factory Constructor:
A factory constructor is also used to create instances, 
but it provides more control over the process. 
It can decide to reuse an existing instance, 
return a different type of object, or perform 
additional logic before creating an instance. 
It's not required to create a new instance every 
time it's called.

syntax:
factory constructor_name(){}
